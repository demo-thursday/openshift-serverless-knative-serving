# OpenShift Serverless - Knative Serving

**Original Demo Date: 2020-05-07**

## Intro

OpenShift Serverless consists of two components; Serving and Eventing.  Serving is based on the upstream Knative Serving project and Eventing is based on Knative Eventing.

At the 2020 Red Hat (Virtual) Summit, the "Serving" component of OpenShift Serverless went GA, with Eventing soon to follow (Summer 2020).  This demo will revolve around OpenShift Serveless: Serving.

## Demo Material

This week we will follow along with this nicely organized [Knative Tutorial](https://redhat-developer-demos.github.io/knative-tutorial/knative-tutorial/index.html), specifically the [Knative Serving](https://redhat-developer-demos.github.io/knative-tutorial/knative-tutorial-serving/index.html) modules.

If you want to run this demo yourself, you can either:
* Use an existing OpenShift 4.x cluster
* Use CodeReady Containers on your local workstation, or
* Use Minikube

Since Knative is Kubernetes-native, and not OpenShift native, it should run just fine on any of these platforms.

... more to come.
